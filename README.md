A lightweight Unity Editor tool that automates creation of organized scene hierarchy structures with one click.

The tool is editor-only, adds no runtime dependencies, and creates only empty GameObjects.

## Features

- **One-click scene setup** – Create organized hierarchies instantly
- **Customizable groups** – Toggle which groups to create
- **Nested child objects** – Optional child hierarchies per group
- **Visual organization** – Dashed formatting for clear hierarchy separation
- **Persistent preferences** – User settings saved via EditorPrefs
- **Smart duplication prevention** – Won't create duplicate objects
- **Full Undo support** – All creations can be undone
- **Selection control** – Option to select created objects after generation
- **Editor-only** – No runtime code or dependencies
